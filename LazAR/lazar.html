<h1>LazAR: An Android App</h1>
<iframe   width="640px" height="480px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_n37hWhz_bw"></iframe>
<h2>What is LazAR?</h2>
<p>LazAR is an innovative application which brings laser tag to mobile devices, without any external peripherals.  Born as a senior capstone project, a team of five students (including myself) worked throughout the Spring 2023 semester to make this crazy idea a reality.  Unfortunately, servers are not free.  The game's online service has ceased.  But some of the legacy of LazAR will hopefully be preserved on this website.</p>
<h2>A View of the Gameplay Loop</h2>
<p>This next section will run through how the app functioned.  That being said, I will focus a little more on things I personally had a hand in developing.  As far as team roles went, I was one of two people working on the main portion of device side code.  Two others worked mostly on the server side, while the final member of the team worked on image recognition for hit detection.  Therefore, I will focus on frontend for this page.</p>

        <p><strong>The Application:</strong> After booting up the app, a user is met with this home screen.  While a very simple design, we felt that streamlining the process to join a game was more important than complicated visuals.</p>

            <strong>My Contributions: </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Title</li>
                <li>App Icon</li>
            </ul>
        <p><strong>My Comments:</strong> I agree with the idea of extremely simplistic design for the most part.  However, given more time, I would have liked to clean things up a bit.  The main thing we never got around to was an options menu.  As far as what is there, I'm especially proud of the title graphic.  I believe small things like that added tremendously to make the game feel like an actual game.</p>
