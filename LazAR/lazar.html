<h1>LazAR: An Android App</h1>
<iframe   width="640px" height="480px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_n37hWhz_bw"></iframe>
<h2>What is LazAR?</h2>
<p>LazAR is an innovative application which brings laser tag to mobile devices, without any external peripherals.  Born as a senior capstone project, a team of five students (including myself) worked throughout the Spring 2023 semester to make this crazy idea a reality.  Unfortunately, servers are not free.  The game's online service has ceased.  But some of the legacy of LazAR will hopefully be preserved on this website.</p>
<h2>A View of the Gameplay Loop</h2>
<p>This next section will run through how the app functioned.  That being said, I will focus a little more on things I personally had a hand in developing.  As far as team roles went, I was one of two people working on the main portion of device side code.  Two others worked mostly on the server side, while the final member of the team worked on image recognition for hit detection.  Therefore, I will focus on frontend for this page.</p>

        <p><strong>The Application:</strong> After booting up the app, a user is met with this home screen.  While a very simple design, we felt that streamlining the process to join a game was more important than complicated visuals.  From here, the user has three options: Host a Game, Join a Game, or Quit.  These buttons should be fairly self-explanatory.</p>

                <li>App Icon</li>
            </ul>
        <p><strong>My Comments:</strong> I agree with the idea of extremely simplistic design for the most part.  However, given more time, I would have liked to clean things up a bit.  The main thing we never got around to was an options menu.  As far as what is there, I'm especially proud of the title graphic.  I believe small things like that added tremendously to make the game feel like an actual game.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="right">
        <p><strong>The Application:</strong> A player presses the button to host the game.  They are given an opportunity to choose their name ("host") and are sent to a room.  This room has a join code of 9r30mc.  A second person can now press join game and put this code into their phone.  After choosing their name ("the boys")
            , the start button becomes active.  The host is now able to start the game.</p>

            <li>Lobby Music</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>My Comments:</strong> I like what we did with this lobby screen.  It probably would have been better to have room codes be either only alphabetic or only numeric, but my group was proud of the algorithms we had to generate the alphanumeric codes.  Even better might be to have a way to send invites to nearby devices.
        However, when we got the lobby music in there, I could feel the excitement of starting a new game when we play-tested.  So it did it's job just fine.</p>

        <p><strong>The Application:</strong> In this simulated game, "host" takes out "the boys".  After losing all of their health, "the boys" are shown the loss screen.  Since "host" is the last player remaining, they are shown the win screen.

        <p><strong>My Comments:</strong> I really like these end screens.  They give the player some lighthearted feedback.  The most important thing they do is make the app feel like a game.
        Traditional laser tag has the advantage of lights, sound, and atmosphere.  These are not all easily done with just a phone, but giving weight to each game in this way helps towards it.</p>

<p>I want to reiterate that this was a team project.  While I focused on stuff I did, here is a list of some cool things other members of my team implemented:</p>
<ul>
    <li>AI vision-powered human detection (with zoom)</li>
    <li>Custom server with HTTPS protocol</li>
    <li>Sound Effects</li>
    <li>Hit verification equation (using GPS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for reading about LazAR!  It was a fun project to be a part of and I hope you thought it was interesting!</p>
