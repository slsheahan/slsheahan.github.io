		<p>Welcome to my first webpage!  I am a new CS/CMPE graduate who is working on learning new skills in software development.  I'm excited to share my progress with you on this site!</p>

		<h2>What even is this site?</h2>
		<p>Simply put, this site is a way to show my experiments and projects that I'm working on.  In addition, it's a project in itself.  For the first week or two, I will be focusing on creating a functional website in HTML.  From there, I might continue to make the site more aesthetically pleasing.  Conversely, I might instead choose to focus on other things.  Who knows?  The world is full of things to discover!</p>
