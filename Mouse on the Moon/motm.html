<p>Mouse on the Moon is a video game I developed for My First Game Jame: Summer 2023.  The theme of this jam was cycles.  There are plenty of different ways to go with this theme, but I was immediately drawn to the moon cycle.  I decided to make the changing moon the play area for my game.  From there, it developed into a adventure/puzzle game about a mouse trying to collect all of the cheese before it is too late.</p>
<p>I am very happy with how it turned out.  If you want to give it a shot, click the link above to see it on itch.io!</p>
